        <p>
            I am currently working as a district manager at PepsiCo and manage a team of over 25 full-time sales reps and merchandisers. Over the past year, I have taken interest in branching out and learning something new, and felt that web development would be a good field to look into. 
        </p>    
        <p>
            I enrolled in a web development bootcamp through Michigan State University and there spent 6 months studying how to create an aesthetically pleasing and proper functioning website.
        </p>    
        <p>
            In addition to these new skills I have developed, I have 3 other skills that will help me be successful in my career:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    My analytical skills, which I acquired while interning at Terrible Herbst when I used a custom VBA code to lower holding costs at convenience stores.
                </li>
                <li>
                    My communication skills, which I developed while working at Nu Skin Enterprises when I secured company profit while simultaneously protecting clientâ€™s interests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    My leadership and organizational abilities, which I have acquired while working at Frito Lay as a District Sales Leader by managing a team of customer service merchandising specialists to increase sales and strengthen relationships.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>  
            I am confident that these skills will make me an asset at your company. Which of these can I expand on for you?
